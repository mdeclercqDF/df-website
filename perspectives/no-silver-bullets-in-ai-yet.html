              Why System Design is the Key to Unlocking Real Value
            </h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-df-dark mt-8 mb-3">We've Seen This Before</h3>

            <p>
              Every few years, a new technology arrives promising to reshape business and society. In the 1990s it was
              client-server and the early web. In the 2000s, SOA and cloud. In the 2010s, mobile, microservices, and big
              data. Each came with sweeping claims, investor enthusiasm, and a long trail of stranded pilots and wasted
              spend.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today it is AI's turn. Generative tools, autonomous agents, and humanoid robotics are attracting record
              funding and media coverage. The potential is enormous. We are genuinely excited by what these technologies
              can do.
            </p>

            <p>
              But as with every wave of transformation, there is a difference between promise and practice. AI is not a
              silver bullet today… not yet. What matters now is how enterprises adopt it in ways that are safe,
              scalable, and aligned with their systems of trust.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-df-dark mt-8 mb-3">Why Hype Fails in the Enterprise</h3>

            <p>
              Enterprises are not greenfields. They are complex, regulated, global systems with deep technical and human
              interdependencies. When "silver bullet" AI pilots collide with this reality, the outcomes are predictable:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Workflow friction:</strong>
                AI that takes away human agency or fails in production quickly loses trust.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Governance gaps:</strong>
                Compliance, audit, and security are often afterthoughts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mismatch with real requirements:</strong>
                Tools designed in the abstract rarely fit enterprise constraints.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The lesson is not that AI will fail. The lesson is that without the right design, even the most powerful
              technologies struggle to deliver at scale.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">What Actually Works</h2>

            <p>From our perspective, durable AI investments require three things:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>System Design Over Silver Bullets:</strong>
                AI is not the system. It is a component within a system. Lasting impact requires thoughtful
                architecture, clear requirements, and extensibility to adapt as the technology evolves.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cross-Industry Fast Learning:</strong>
                Every sector is experimenting with AI. The lessons travel. Insights from healthcare can inform finance,
                logistics, and government. Fast learning across industries accelerates progress.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Actionable, Co-Created Solutions:</strong>
                Technology succeeds when it is designed with the people who will use and govern it, not imposed from
                outside.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This approach not only avoids the pitfalls of hype, it accelerates confidence and helps organizations
              leverage AI faster, with fewer surprises.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">The Conversation We Should Be Having</h2>

            <p>Instead of asking "How fast can we adopt AI?" leaders should be asking:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>What patterns from past hype cycles can help us avoid repeating mistakes?</li>
              <li>Where are the hidden costs of failure if pilots don't scale?</li>
              <li>How do we make sure AI strengthens, rather than breaks, our systems of trust?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              These are the questions that unlock smarter investments, and they are the questions we have been helping
              clients answer for more than 30 years.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">Our Point of View</h2>

            <p>
              We believe AI is one of the most important technological shifts of our time. It is already reshaping
              industries, and its potential will only grow. At the same time, it will not replace the need for solid
              system design, disciplined requirements, and human-centered solutions. There may not be a silver bullet
              yet. But with the right design, AI investments can become durable advantages - and we know how to help
              organizations get there.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let's talk about how to turn AI potential into enterprise outcomes, faster and with greater confidence.

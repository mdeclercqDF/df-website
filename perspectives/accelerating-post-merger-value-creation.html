              Value realization often depends on speed of integration. Learn how a structured data ingest strategy can

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">
              Why Post-Merger Integration Fails Without a Data Strategy
            </h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-df-dark mt-8 mb-3">Acquisitions Don't Create Value on Their Own</h3>

            <p>
              In every roll-up, merger, or portfolio growth strategy, value is unlocked not at the point of acquisition
              but in the speed and precision of integration.
            </p>

            <p>
              Systems must be consolidated. Teams need shared tools. Audit trails, customer records, and operational
              data have to move into new formats, often under time pressure and without full documentation.
            </p>

            <p>Too often, that transition is underestimated.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Revenue realization slows as teams operate in parallel systems</li>
              <li>Talent grows frustrated by unfamiliar or outdated tools</li>
              <li>Operational synergy gets delayed while data remains siloed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The result is predictable: integration becomes a long tail of clean-up projects, slowing momentum and
              reducing the return on the deal.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-df-dark mt-8 mb-3">The Integration Imperative</h3>

            <p>
              For enterprise leaders, the challenge isn't whether integration issues will arise—they will. The question
              is how quickly they can be solved in a way that creates alignment, preserves trust, and sets the
              foundation for scale.
            </p>

            <p>That starts with the data.</p>

            <p>
              In many cases, the most valuable asset in an acquired business isn't the software - it's the institutional
              knowledge encoded in its data: client relationships, workflows, decision trails, and risk models. Without
              a structured approach to ingesting and standardizing that data, the organization carries forward friction
              that compounds with every new acquisition.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">A Smarter Approach: The Ingest Engine</h2>

            <p>
              One pattern we've seen work is treating integration as a repeatable capability, not a one-off project.
              Think of it as an
              <strong>ingest engine</strong>
              - a purpose-built layer that can:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Ingest and normalize data from acquired systems</li>
              <li>Standardize it into a shared model</li>
              <li>Feed it into the core platform, product, or workflow</li>
              <li>Operate with minimal disruption to end users</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This approach shortens time-to-value, creates consistency across business units, and reduces the risk of
              poor decision-making due to mismatched or delayed data.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than building a new system every time, the ingest engine becomes a reusable tool in the enterprise
              integration playbook.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">Our Point of View</h2>

            <p>
              Digital transformation is often about building something new. But in M&amp;A, the fastest path to value is
              often about what you can absorb and standardize quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
              We've helped organizations build ingestion and data onboarding capabilities to support post-merger scale,
              regulatory compliance, and platform consolidation. These aren't shiny demos. They're the technical
              foundations that make the business case for M&amp;A real.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you're navigating acquisitions or planning for integration at scale, we'd be happy to share what we've
              learned and help define a plan that accelerates value creation instead of delaying it.

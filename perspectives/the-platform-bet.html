              Building a mission-critical platform? Learn why early architecture decisions are business decisions and
              how to get them right from the start.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">Why Architecture Is Your First Business Decision</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-df-dark mt-8 mb-3">The Stakes Are High</h3>

            <p>
              You've made the call. Your organization is investing in a new, mission-critical platform. It might be a
              case management system, a claims engine, a next-gen data layer, or something else core to the business.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whatever the domain, the pattern is the same: this platform needs to deliver real value, integrate across
              systems, and scale as the business evolves. You don't get a second chance once it becomes operational.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is the Platform Bet. A big investment in a system that has to be architected correctly from the
              start.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-df-dark mt-8 mb-3">Where Things Break Down</h3>

            <p>
              Even with smart teams and clear goals, we've seen these programs lose momentum. Not because the vision is
              wrong, but because early technical decisions don't line up with how the organization actually operates.
            </p>

            <p>Some of the common failure points:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>MVP cuts the wrong corners.</strong>
                To go fast, foundational elements like observability, extensibility, and compliance readiness get
                postponed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ownership is scattered.</strong>
                Different teams have partial visibility, but no one owns the full technical picture.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Integration is underestimated.</strong>
                Legacy interfaces, security models, and data inconsistencies show up late and slow everything down.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Architecture is deferred.</strong>
                Business strategy takes center stage, while core system design is kicked down the road.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The result is a platform that might demo well, but doesn't hold up in production. And fixing it later is
              expensive.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">What Actually Works</h2>

            <p>
              We've seen Platform Bets succeed when architecture is treated as a first-class business decision. That
              means:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Keeping senior engineering close to both the planning and the build</li>
              <li>Aligning architecture with business objectives, not just product specs</li>
              <li>Prototyping critical flows before committing to full-scale implementation</li>
              <li>Making time for system design early, even in agile environments</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This helps teams move faster, not slower. It reduces rework and avoids downstream surprises. It gives
              stakeholders a shared language for evaluating tradeoffs and making decisions that scale.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">Our Point of View</h2>

            <p>
              We've helped clients across industries make these kinds of bets and deliver on them. From building
              cloud-native platforms to replacing brittle mainframe systems, we've been brought in to make sure the
              foundation holds.
            </p>

            <p>
              At Digital Foundry, we combine strategic framing with deep technical execution. We don't hand off
              architecture diagrams or create decks that someone else has to translate. We work shoulder to shoulder
              with clients to design and build systems that work in real conditions, across departments, vendors, and
              constraints.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you're planning a platform investment and want to make sure it's built to last, we'd be happy to talk.
            </p>

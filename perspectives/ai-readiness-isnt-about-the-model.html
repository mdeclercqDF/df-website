            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">Pilots are Easy. Production is Hard.</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-df-dark mt-8 mb-3">From Experimentation to Execution</h3>

            <p>
              AI adoption is accelerating across industries. Enterprise teams are deploying pilots using tools like
              GitHub Copilot, Gemini, and domain-specific LLMs. These early initiatives often demonstrate real
              potential, whether through improved access to information, operational efficiency, or enhanced decision
              support.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite promising early signals, few pilots scale into production environments. Many stall during the
              transition from concept to implementation, resulting in missed expectations, delayed impact, and
              diminished stakeholder confidence.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-df-dark mt-8 mb-3">The Core Issue Lies Beyond the Model</h3>

            <p>
              In most cases, the root cause is not model performance. It is the broader enterprise environment. Legacy
              systems, siloed data, fragmented access controls, security policies, and regulatory oversight all
              introduce significant complexity. Pilots built in isolation from these realities are unlikely to survive
              operational deployment without substantial rework.
            </p>

            <p>This disconnect leads to several predictable outcomes:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Momentum loss as pilot fatigue sets in</li>
              <li>Shadow deployments that bypass organizational standards</li>
              <li>Technical architectures that cannot support scale or maintainability</li>
              <li>Governance and compliance gaps</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In short, the enterprise is not ready - not because the technology is immature, but because the
              surrounding systems and processes are not prepared to support it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">Rethinking AI Readiness</h2>

            <p>
              Effective AI readiness requires more than enthusiasm and experimentation. It demands a deliberate approach
              to design, integration, and governance.
            </p>

            <p>Organizations must address foundational questions early in the process:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Does the operating model support responsible use, oversight, and long-term evolution?</li>
              <li>Are non-functional requirements defined and validated before deployment?</li>
              <li>Is the architecture extensible, maintainable, and aligned with enterprise integration points?</li>
              <li>Can the solution meet security, observability, and policy requirements?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Without clear answers to these questions, pilots may demonstrate value but fail to deliver it.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">Our Perspective</h2>

            <p>
              At Digital Foundry, we believe AI should be approached as a system-level capability, not a standalone
              experiment. Successful adoption depends on whether the organization is positioned to integrate, govern,
              and scale the technology effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our work focuses on bridging the gap between experimentation and enterprise implementation. This includes
              assessing architectural readiness, defining non-functional requirements, and designing systems that align
              with the organization's operational and compliance needs.
            </p>

            <p>Pilots are easy to build. Production systems are not. The difference is in the design.</p>

            <p>
              If your organization is committed to moving AI beyond the pilot phase, we welcome the opportunity to share
              what we've learned and to help define a roadmap tailored to your specific environment.
            </p>

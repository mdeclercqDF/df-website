              A pragmatic strategy for moving AI out of the demo phase and into the operational core, without rewriting
              your legacy systems.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most enterprises operate on what insiders often describe as "the hairball": a dense cluster of legacy
              applications, evolving data models, decades of workflow decisions, and integrations that have accumulated
              over time. It runs the business, but it also makes change hard. This complexity helps explain why early AI
              experiments have struggled to drive operational impact. Chatbots and RAG interfaces sit outside the core,
              generating answers but unable to influence the systems where real work happens.
            </p>

            <p>
              For thirty years, we have seen this pattern repeat across technology waves. The first phase brings
              exploration and high expectations. The second phase demands practical integration, governance, and
              measurable value. AI is now entering that second phase, and two developments are enabling the shift: AI
              agents and Model Context Protocol (MCP).
            </p>

            <p>
              They don't simplify the underlying complexity, but they do allow AI to work with legacy systems without
              changing how those systems fundamentally operate. This creates a practical way to introduce AI into real
              workflows without rewriting the platforms those workflows depend on.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">Why Agents and MCP Create New Possibilities</h2>

            <p>
              The primary barrier to operational AI has never been the model's intelligence. It has always been the
              operational environment. Enterprise systems contain complex dependencies, long-lived data structures, and
              critical business logic that limit how far a conversational interface can go.
            </p>

            <p>
              Agents change this dynamic because they can act more like junior analysts: retrieving information,
              evaluating conditions, running validations, summarizing results, and coordinating multi-step tasks. They
              can also correlate information across systems that have never been linked, completing work that
              traditionally required manual stitching.
            </p>

            <p>
              MCP provides the structured layer that describes which actions exist, how to call them, what parameters
              they require, and what boundaries must be respected. Think of MCP as a translation layer that tells an
              agent what your systems can do and how to interact with them safely.
            </p>

            <p>
              MCP differs from traditional API integration in one critical way: it provides semantic descriptions that
              AI can reason about. If an MCP server exposes a capability like
              <code>get_customer_orders(customer_id, date_range)</code>
              , the agent understands what the function does and what information it needs—not through hardcoded logic,
              but through reading the definition.
            </p>

            <p>
              So when someone asks, "Why hasn't ACME Construction received their last shipment?", the agent can discover
              and chain together the relevant tools: look up the customer, fetch their orders, check shipment status,
              and pull logistics tracking. No developer wrote code for that specific question. The agent reasoned about
              which capabilities to use and in what sequence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Traditional integration requires developers to anticipate questions and build specific workflows. MCP lets
              agents adapt to questions no one has anticipated, using whatever system capabilities the protocol exposes.
            </p>

            <p>In practical terms, MCP defines:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>the format of actions and responses</li>
              <li>the constraints and governance that apply</li>
              <li>the data sources it may access</li>
              <li>the system capabilities an agent can use</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This allows AI to operate adjacent to enterprise systems in a controlled, predictable way. MCP does not
              modernize the legacy environment. It creates a safe and intelligible boundary that AI can work through.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">A Practical Strategy for Adoption</h2>

            <p>
              The most successful early AI deployments begin with precision, not scale. Organizations should identify
              one workflow where teams lose time on repetitive steps such as gathering data, checking dependencies,
              reviewing for completeness, or stitching together information across systems. They can then expose only
              the relevant system actions through MCP and pair them with an agent that can interpret instructions and
              chain tasks together.
            </p>

            <p>This targeted approach delivers several advantages:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>a grounded environment to learn how agents perform under real constraints</li>
              <li>a repeatable pattern that scales naturally to adjacent processes</li>
              <li>increased confidence among teams who see AI improving their actual workflow</li>
              <li>
                measurable operational value without broad disruption (less time spent gathering data, checking
                dependencies, or stitching together information across systems)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This mirrors what has guided successful digital transformations for decades. Progress comes not from
              untangling the entire hairball at once, but from creating clear, well-governed pathways around it and
              expanding them over time.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">A Clear View of What Comes Next</h2>

            <p>
              We remain realistic about the near-term capabilities of AI. It will not run enterprises autonomously, and
              it should not operate without oversight. But AI can now interact with systems in ways that meaningfully
              reduce friction, speed up workflows, and extend the reach of teams when deployed with structure and
              intention.
            </p>

            <p>Agents bring reasoning and execution. MCP brings clarity and governance.</p>

            <p>
              Together, they offer one of the first credible paths to move AI from experimentation into the operational
              flow of the business.
            </p>

            <p>
              Organizations that pursue this shift with discipline and strategic focus will build a lasting advantage.
              Those that rely on hype or silver-bullet solutions will find themselves revisiting familiar lessons. The
              opportunity is real and so is the need to approach it with both ambition and pragmatism.

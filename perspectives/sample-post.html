              The gap between AI demos and production systems is where most organizations stumble. After deploying AI
              systems for enterprise clients over the past several years, we've identified the patterns that separate
              successful AI initiatives from expensive experiments.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">The Demo-to-Production Gap</h2>
            <p>
              It's never been easier to build an impressive AI demo. Modern LLMs, pre-trained models, and cloud AI
              services mean that a skilled engineer can create a compelling proof-of-concept in days. But the distance
              from that demo to a production system that reliably serves real users at scale is enormous.
            </p>
            <p>
              We see organizations fall into the same traps repeatedly: they invest heavily in model development while
              underinvesting in the engineering foundation that makes AI systems reliable, observable, and maintainable.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">The Three Pillars of Production AI</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-df-dark mt-8 mb-3">1. Data Engineering First</h3>
            <p>
              The quality of your AI system is bounded by the quality of your data pipeline. Before investing in model
              architecture, invest in data quality, lineage, versioning, and monitoring. The organizations that get AI
              right treat data engineering as a first-class discipline, not an afterthought.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-df-dark mt-8 mb-3">2. MLOps as a Foundation</h3>
            <p>
              Model training is a small fraction of the total system. Serving infrastructure, A/B testing frameworks,
              model monitoring, drift detection, and automated retraining pipelines are where the real engineering
              complexity lives. Without mature MLOps, every model deployment becomes a manual, error-prone process.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-df-dark mt-8 mb-3">3. Human-in-the-Loop Design</h3>
            <p>
              The most successful enterprise AI systems aren't fully autonomous. They augment human decision-making with
              intelligent recommendations, confidence scores, and clear escalation paths. Designing for human oversight
              from the start leads to faster adoption and better outcomes.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-df-dark mt-12 mb-4">What We Recommend</h2>
            <p>
              Start with the business outcome, not the technology. Define success metrics before selecting an approach.
              Build the engineering foundation (data pipelines, serving infrastructure, monitoring) before optimizing
              models. And always, always plan for the human element.
            </p>
            <p>
              The organizations that succeed with AI treat it as an engineering discipline, not a research project. They
              staff their teams with production-minded engineers, establish clear quality gates, and invest in the
              unglamorous infrastructure that makes AI reliable at scale.
            </p>
